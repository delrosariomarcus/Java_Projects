This project is a student record that has the following information: id, last name, first name, major, phone number, GPA, birth year, birth month, birth date, home address.

Before staring the program, make sure that the two files are in the same folder, DataStrucProj.java and DataStrucProjProg.java. After, the file that must be run is DataStrucProjProg.java as this has the main class.

Under the program, I have created a menu on my main class which can do the following:
  1. Add a student record
  2. Delete a record by ID
  3. Print or display all the students in the database.
  4. Sort the list by ID, GPA, birthday.
  5. Search and Output a student by either ID or major.

For adding a student record, the program would ask the user information regarding the student id, last name, first name, major, phone number, gpa, birth year, birth date, and home address. For the birthdays, the inputs must be a number and not a string.

To delete a student, the user must input the exact ID number for the deletion to be successful.

The display operation just prints all the information in the current database.

For the sorting, user can sort in an ascending or descending order. To do so, enter 'a' for ascending and 'd' for descending. Please make sure it is in lower case as the inputs are case sensitive. After doing so, the program would ask if user wants to sort by ID, gpa, or birthday. If user wants to sort by ID, enter '1'; If user wants to sort by GPA, enter '3'; If If user wants to sort by birthday, enter '3'

To search and display a student, program would ask if they want to search using the ID or major. If user chooses ID, he/she must enter 'i' (must be in lower case). After doing so, they must enter the 8-digit student id. On the other hand, when user selects major, the input shall be 'm'. With this, he/she must enter major. The input of major must be in the right cases and spacing. Therefore, user's input must exactly match the major in the database. 

To exit the program, user just press the enter on the keyboard.
